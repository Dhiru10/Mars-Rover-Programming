# Mars-Rover-Programming

This C++ program showcases a Mars Rover simulation, incorporating key principles and design patterns. The Rover initialized with a starting position and direction, executes movement and turning commands ('M', 'L', 'R'). The Command Pattern is employed, encapsulating these commands for flexibility. The Composite Pattern represents the grid and obstacles, ensuring a scalable and organized structural design.

The code adheres to SOLID principles, emphasizing clarity and maintaining global understandability. The program adeptly manages logging, exceptions, and validations to enhance code quality, demonstrating a commitment to gold standards. The concise status report, revealing the final position and obstacle status, exemplifies the program's user-friendly output. This simulation is a practical example of design patterns, OOP principles, and coding best practices in action.
