# Mars-Rover-Programming

This C++ program encapsulates a Mars Rover simulation, embodying Object-Oriented Programming principles and design patterns. It features a Rover initialized with a starting position and direction, capable of executing commands ('M', 'L', 'R') for movement and turning. The program leverages the Command Pattern to encapsulate these commands, ensuring flexibility and extensibility.

The implementation adheres to the Composite Pattern to represent the grid and obstacles, fostering a structural design that is both scalable and organized. Obstacle detection is seamlessly integrated, allowing the Rover to navigate while avoiding obstacles intelligently. Additionally, the code incorporates elements of clarity and adherence to SOLID principles, maintaining global understandability and adhering to coding conventions.

To enhance code quality, the program effectively handles logging, exceptions, and validations, showcasing a commitment to gold standards. The concise status report, providing the final position and obstacle status of the Rover, exemplifies the program's attention to user-friendly output. Overall, this Mars Rover simulation serves as a practical demonstration of design patterns, OOP principles, and coding best practices.
